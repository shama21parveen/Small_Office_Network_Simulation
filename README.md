#  Small Office Network Simulation - Cisco Packet Tracer

This project is a simulation of a small office network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. All devices are manually configured with **static IP addresses** to enable reliable internal communication.

## Network Overview
- **Router:** Cisco 1941
- **Switches:** Cisco 2960 Series
- **Devices:** PCs for Admin, HR, Finance, and Server

##  Features
- Static IP Addressing  
- LAN Communication  
- Layer 2 Switching  
- Basic Router Configuration  
- Connectivity Test via ICMP (Ping)

## Skills Demonstrated
- Network Topology Design  
- Cisco Device Configuration  
- IP Address Planning  
- Troubleshooting & Network Verification  
- Packet Tracer Simulation
